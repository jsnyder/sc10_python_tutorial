Exercise 1:

The file grades.txt has the following format:

name                 gender     class                   grades
(string of chars)    (M or F)   (class number)          (10 grades as integer percentages)

Safely read in a dataset from the file grades.txt, without using a "for" or "while" loop to perform the calculations:

* each student's average
* the average grade on tests
* the average grades for males and females
* the average male and female grades for just class 2

then print out all results in the format:

Student     Class       Average
name        class       average_grade
name        class       average_grade
name        class       average_grade
name        class       average_grade
name        class       average_grade

Male Average: male_average_grade
Female Average: female_average_grade

Class 1 Male Average:
Class 1 Female Average:
Class 2 Male Average:
Class 2 Female Average:
Class 3 Male Average:
Class 3 Female Average:
